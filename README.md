# OLST_prediction_part_1
Predict OLST based on BESS 


In this project, One Limb Stance Test (OLST) trial were recorded by camera motion capture system and force plates.
Firstly, we wrote a MatLab script (hardcoded system) to extract the information of OLST and rated the OLST performance according to Balance Error Scoring System (BESS).
Then we built other two automated rating systems including unsupervised learning model and supervised learning model based on the extracted information from MatlLab to predict the OLST performance.

The repository includes the scripts for data extraction, data processing, feature engineering, model building and evaluation
